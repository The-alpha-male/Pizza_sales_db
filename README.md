# Pizza_sales_db

## Project Scenario
A client is opening up a new pizzeria and gives a project build. He requires you to build a tailor-made bespoke relational database for his business that will allow him to capture and store all the important information and data that the business generates this will help monitor the business performance.

The main areas of focus are;
    - `Orders`
    - `Stock control`
    - `Staff`
Orders data required include;
  - Item name
  - Item price
  - Quantity
  - Customer name
  - Delivery address

## Stock order requirements
The client wants to know when it's time to order new stock.
To do this we need to know;
    - what ingredients are used to make the pizza
    - quantity based on pizza size
    - existing stock level
The assumption will be that the lead time for delivery by suppliers is the same for all ingredients

## Staff data requirements
- The client wants to know  which staff members are working and when
- Based on the staff salary info, how much does each pizza cost (ingredients + chefs + delivery )
## Objectives
1. Build SQL database
2. Write custom SQL Queries
3. Build an interactive dashboard
